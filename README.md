<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>I am a tenacious person, one of the qualities on which I pride myself in. On one hand I am organized, attentive, and intutitive in my decision making. And on the other hand I love to communicate, which is the bedrock of any collaboration, communication that comes with empathy and the willingness to listen and in turn solve problems together.</p>
<p> I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Babcock University, Nigeria and have served in various leadership capacities, in addition to this I have garnered experience with about 3+ years in the software development field, worked on many projects within Nigeria and Africa at large </p>
<p> Exploiting my much gathered knowledge and skill, I continue to look towards personal development and contributing to organization successes in whatever capacity I find myself. Confident in my the ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams to solve complex, high-stakes problems.

<h2> Examples of My Work </h2>
<h3>Login Use Cases with Selenium</h3>
<p> Here I use Selenium and Webdriver.io combined with Test NG assertions to explore some login use cases on a login page, both negative and positive cases
 ,to capture a typical automation using the selenuim framework and Java programming language. <p>
   https://github.com/chinatu/Login-Selenium-Project.git
  
<h3>Todo List Test Cases with Cypress <h3>
  <p> Here I used Cypress and Javascript combined with the Page Object Model to design a demo set of testcases for a React todo Application I created. Here a basic concept of retriving elements and retrieving the elements to perform a couple of tests is done using cypress. <p>
  <p> Another powerful feature of Cypress is its ability to provide real-time feedback and debugging tools to developers. The Cypress Test Runner allows developers to view the application and the automated tests side-by-side, making it easy to identify and diagnose any issues that may arise during testing. <p>
  <p> The React Application repo is located here https://github.com/chinatu/TodoList-React-App <p>

 <h3> Exeat Management System <h3>
   <p> This project formed the foundation of my Research Project in final year undergraduate, here I developed a Java Desktop Application that tackles the issue of managing exeat in a school system.<p>
   <p> Using javafx, scenebuilder and sql to bring the project to life, here I made a consious decision of using javafx over swing because of some of the advantages javafx offered over swing at the time. <p>
