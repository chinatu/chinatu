<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>I am a tenacious person, one of the qualities on which I pride myself in. On one hand I am organized, attentive, and intutitive in my decision making. And on the other hand I love to communicate, which is the bedrock of any collaboration, communication that comes with empathy and the willingness to listen and in turn solve problems together.</p>
<p> I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Babcock University, Nigeria and have served in various leadership capacities, in addition to this I have garnered experience with about 2-3 years in the software development field, worked on many projects within Nigeria and Africa at large </p>
<p> Exploiting my much gathered knowledge and skill, I continue to look towards personal development and contributing to organization successes in whatever capacity I find myself. Confident in my the ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams to solve complex, high-stakes problems.
</p>

<h2> Examples of My Work </h2>

<h3>Login Use Cases with Selenium<h3>
<p> Here I use Selenium and Webdriver.io combined with Test NG assertions to explore some login use cases on a login page, both negative and positive cases
 , to capture a typical automation using the selenuim framework and Java programming language. <p>
